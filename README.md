# knucklebones-solver
Knucklebones Solver using minimax and mean-weighting for random probabilities

## TODO
- optimize
  - alpha-beta pruning
  - profiling and micro optimizations
  - rewrite in rust -> wasm
  - profiling and micro optimizations
  - tail call recursion optimization
  - manually rewrite recursion as a loop
- implement auto-place (button to automatically place the suggested position)
  - this should also remove dice from the opponent's board if necessary
- implement auto-format (top-align the dice / remove blank cells and move dice to the top)
- add reset button
